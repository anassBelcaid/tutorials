abstract = {Array CGH is a powerful technique for genomic studies of cancer. It enables one to carry out genome-wide screening for regions of genetic alterations, such as chromosome gains and losses, or localized amplifications and deletions. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm 'Cluster along chromosomes' (CLAC) for the analysis of array CGH data. CLAC builds hierarchical clustering-style trees along each chromosome arm (or chromosome), and then selects the 'interesting' clusters by controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) at a certain level. In addition, it provides a consensus summary across a set of arrays, as well as an estimate of the corresponding FDR. We illustrate the method using an application of CLAC on a lung cancer microarray CGH data set as well as a BAC array CGH data set of aneuploid cell strains.},

abstract = {We develop and analyze methods for computing provably optimal \{$\backslash$em maximum a posteriori\} (MAP) configurations for a subclass of Markov random fields defined on graphs with cycles. By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: (a) a \{$\backslash$em tree-relaxed linear program\} (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and (b) a \{$\backslash$em tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm\} that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem, and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm.},

@article{Boykov1999,
abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of minimizing a large class of energy functions that occur in early vision. The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an alpha-beta-swap: for a pair of labels alpha,beta, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled alpha and another arbitrary set labeled beta. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an alpha-expansion: for a label alpha, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label alpha. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion.},

@article{Boykov2001,
abstract = {Many tasks in computer vision involve assigning a label (such as
disparity) to every pixel. A common constraint is that the labels should
vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities
that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally
stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide
class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global
minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest
discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient
approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts
that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large
moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can
simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In
contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use
small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our
expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global
minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions.
Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity
preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with
ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy},

abstract = {Graph cut is a popular technique for interactive image segmentation. However, it has certain shortcomings. In particular, graph cut has problems with segmenting thin elongated objects due to the ldquoshrinking biasrdquo. To overcome this problem, we propose to impose an additional connectivity prior, which is a very natural assumption about objects. We formulate several versions of the connectivity constraint and show that the corresponding optimization problems are all NP-hard. For some of these versions we propose two optimization algorithms: (i) a practical heuristic technique which we call DijkstraGC, and (ii) a slow method based on problem decomposition which provides a lower bound on the problem. We use the second technique to verify that for some practical examples DijkstraGC is able to find the global minimum.},

It then presents dynamic programming based segmentation algorithms for noisy and textured images, considering a statistical maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Due to computational concerns, however, sub-optimal versions of the algorithms are devised through simplifying approximations in the model. Since model parameters are needed for the segmentation algorithms, a new parameter estimation technique is developed for estimating the parameters in a GD. Finally, a number of examples are presented which show the usefulness of the Gibbsian model and the effectiveness of the segmentation algorithms and the parameter estimation procedures.},

Here we prove a result on the fixed points of$\backslash$nmax-product on a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary$\backslash$nprobability distributions (discrete- or continuous-valued nodes). We$\backslash$nshow that the assignment based on a fixed point is a \&amp;ldquo;neighborhood$\backslash$nmaximum\&amp;rdquo; of the posterior probability: the posterior probability$\backslash$nof the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other$\backslash$nassignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The$\backslash$nregion includes all assignments that differ from the max-product$\backslash$nassignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop$\backslash$nin the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially large.$\backslash$nWe illustrate the analysis with examples},

abstract = {The first processing stage in computational vision, also called early vision, consists of decoding two-dimensional images in terms of properties of 3-0 surfaces. Early vision includes problems such as the recovery of motion and optical flow, shape from shading, surface interpolation, and edge detection. These are inverse prob-lems, which are often ill-posed or ill-conditioned. We review here the relevant mathematical results on ill-posed and ill-conditioned problems and introduce the formal aspects of regularization the-ory in the linear and nonlinear case. Specific topics in early vision and their regularization are then analyzed rigorously, characteriz-ing existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions.},
