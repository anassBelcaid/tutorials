#Graph tool first steps

# Installation
Since _graph-tool_ is implemented in __C++__, its installation doesn't follow the simple _pip install packageName_ pattern. Some basic suffering is needed in order to complete the list of dependencies. Based in my experience a installation from source is the best option in order to combine specific compiler of _C++_ and _python_. For my case I use brew __gcc__ and _anacondda_ python compiler. On must check and intall all the dependencies listed in the package documentation.
